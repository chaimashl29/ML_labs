# Machine Learning Labs

## Lab 1: Breast Cancer Classification with Mixed Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM
This lab focuses on implementing and comparing different machine learning classification algorithms for predicting breast cancer diagnoses based on a dataset of features.

## Lab 2: Data Preprocessing and Outlier Detection in Hepatitis Dataset
This lab focuses on data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, detecting outliers, and understanding correlations in the hepatitis dataset.

## Lab 3: Student Score Prediction
This notebook demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for predicting student exam scores based on the number of hours they study. The dataset used in this notebook contains information about students' study hours and their corresponding exam scores. The goal is to build a model that can predict the scores based on study hours.

## Lab 4: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
This notebook demonstrates clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods for high-dimensional data.
